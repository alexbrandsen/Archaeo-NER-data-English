## Files

The all.txt file contains all annotated data. As the data is quite varied, 5 fold cross validation is recommended, and these are provided in the 5-folds folder. The 5-folds-test-train-val-split folder contains the 5 folds already split into test, train and validation splits, for ease of use.
