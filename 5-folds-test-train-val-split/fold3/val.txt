CONCLUSION NNP O
4.1 CD O
St NNP B-LOC

Northampton NNP I-LOC
is VBZ O
a DT O
fine JJ O
and CC O
largely RB O
complete JJ O
surviving VBG O
example NN O
of IN O
a DT O
school NN B-CON
built VBN O
by IN O
a DT O
local JJ O
authority NN O
at IN O
a DT O
time NN O
when WRB O
the DT O
population NN O
of IN O
the DT O
town NN O
was VBD O
growing VBG O
and CC O
education NN O
for IN O
all DT O
was VBD O
seen VBN O
as IN O
a DT O
necessity NN O
, , O
not RB O
a DT O
luxury NN O
. . O

The DT O
quality NN O
of IN O
the DT O
school NN B-CON
buildings NNS I-CON
is VBZ O
remarkably RB O
high JJ O
( ( O
even RB O
if IN O
the DT O

let VBP O

within IN O
a DT O

. . O

This DT O
quality NN O
perhaps RB O
reflects VBZ O
the DT O
Education NNP O
Committees NNP O
new JJ O
administration NN O
of IN O
the DT O
local JJ O
education NN O
and CC O
indicates VBZ O
a DT O
certain JJ O
civic JJ O
pride NN O
in IN O
the DT O
provision NN O
of IN O
the DT O
buildings NNS B-CON
. . O

All DT O
of IN O
the DT O
school NN B-CON
buildings NNS I-CON
recorded VBN O
were VBD O
built VBN O
in IN O
a DT O
single JJ O
phase NN O
by IN O
the DT O
same JJ O
architect NN O
and CC O
have VBP O
remained VBN O
essentially RB O
un-altered JJ O
apart NN O
from IN O
minor JJ O
internal JJ O
alterations NNS O
and CC O
the DT O

of IN O

Externally RB O
the DT O
buildings NNS B-CON
have VBP O
changed VBN O
very RB O
little JJ O
. . O

4.2 CD O
Whilst NNP O
the DT O
buildings NNS B-CON
have VBP O
survived VBN O
remarkably RB O
unaltered JJ O
they PRP O
apparently RB O
no RB O
longer RBR O
provide VB O
the DT O
needs NNS O
of IN O
modern JJ B-PER
education NN O
. . O

The DT O
layout NN O
of IN O
the DT O
buildings NNS B-CON
has VBZ O
been VBN O
primarily RB O
dictated VBN O
by IN O
the DT O
shape NN O
and CC O
size NN O
of IN O
the DT O
plot NN O
of IN O
land NN O
available JJ O
, , O
and CC O
it PRP O
is VBZ O
known VBN O
from IN O
the DT O
documentary JJ O
sources NNS O
that IN O
the DT O
committee NN O
did VBD O
not RB O
like IN O
to TO O
have VB O
classrooms NNS O
facing VBG O
north NN O
. . O

In IN O
fact NN O
, , O
the DT O
architect NN O
overcame NN O
this DT O
problem NN O
in IN O
the DT O
main JJ O
block NN O
by IN O
giving VBG O
all PDT O
the DT O
classrooms NNS O
either CC O
south JJ O
facing NN O
windows NNS O
( ( O
12 CD O

) ) O
or CC O
east $ O
or CC O
west JJS O
facing NN O
rooms NNS O
( ( O
2 CD O
) ) O
. . O

The DT O
north JJ O
side NN O
of IN O
the DT O
building NN O
was VBD O
taken VBN O
up RP O
by IN O
the DT O
corridor NN O
, , O
cloakrooms NNS O
and CC O
storage NN O
or CC O
staff NN O
rooms NNS O
. . O

The DT O
central JJ O
hall NN O
allowed VBD O
the DT O
two CD O
halves NNS O
of IN O
the DT O
school NN B-CON
to TO O
have VB O
easy JJ O
access NN O
to TO O
this DT O
shared VBN O
facility NN O
, , O
a DT O
practical JJ O
and CC O
economic JJ O
method NN O
of IN O
providing VBG O
a DT O
large JJ O
space NN O
. . O

In IN O
the DT O
infants NNS O
block VBP O
the DT O
layout NN O
is VBZ O
more RBR O
compact JJ O
, , O
arranged VBN O
around IN O
a DT O
central JJ O
hall NN O
. . O

The DT O
individual NN O
classrooms NNS O
have VBP O
exactly RB O
the DT O
same JJ O
configuration NN O
, , O
though RB O
here RB O
two CD O
rooms NNS O
are VBP O
lit VBN O
only RB O
from IN O
the DT O
north NN O
. . O

4.4 CD O
The DT O
main JJ O
problem NN O
of IN O
the DT O
site NN O
survey NN O
has VBZ O
been VBN O
the DT O
lack NN O
of IN O
information NN O
regarding VBG O
how WRB O
the DT O
school NN O
was VBD O
used VBN O
other JJ O
than IN O
being VBG O
able JJ O
to TO O
establish VB O
the DT O
main JJ O
circulation NN O
routes NNS O
, , O
and CC O
the DT O
distinction NN O
of IN O
the DT O
staff NN O
and CC O
pupil NN O
areas NNS O
. . O

It PRP O
is VBZ O
probable JJ O
, , O
however RB O
, , O
that IN O
the DT O
individual JJ O
rooms NNS O
did VBD O
not RB O
have VB O
any DT O
subject JJ O
specific JJ O
layouts NNS O
or CC O
fittings NNS O
, , O
for IN O
most JJS O
subjects NNS O
all DT O
that WDT O
was VBD O
needed VBN O
was VBD O
a DT O
black JJ B-ART
board NN I-ART
and CC O
subject JJ O
books NNS B-ART
. . O

Indeed RB O
, , O
all DT O
of IN O
the DT O
classrooms NNS O
in IN O
both DT O
buildings NNS O
are VBP O
the DT O
same JJ O
with IN O
no DT O
variation NN O
in IN O
layout NN O
. . O

The DT O
single JJ O
exception NN O
is VBZ O
room NN O
21 CD O
of IN O
the DT O
infants NNS O
building NN O
which WDT O
is VBZ O
a DT O
little JJ O
larger JJR O
than IN O
the DT O
others NNS O
. . O

There EX O
are VBP O
not RB O
even RB O
any DT O
surviving VBG O
fireplaces NNS O
in IN O
these DT O
two CD O
rooms NNS O
and CC O
all DT O
of IN O
the DT O
tiles NNS O
have VBP O
been VBN O
removed VBN O
or CC O
covered VBN O
, , O
thus RB O
rendering VBG O
any DT O
attempt NN O
to TO O
establish VB O
its PRP$ O
original JJ O
use NN O
impossible JJ O
. . O

It PRP O
is VBZ O
simply RB O
labelled VBN O
as IN O
classroom NN O
on IN O
the DT O
1920 CD B-PER
plan NN O
though IN O
there EX O
must MD O
be VB O
a DT O
reason NN O
for IN O
its PRP$ O
larger JJR O
size NN O
. . O

4.5 CD O
Later NNP O
on IN O
, , O
the DT O
teaching NN O
of IN O

required VBN O
the DT O
provision NN O
of IN O

in IN O
the DT O
main JJ O

, , O
but CC O
at IN O
the DT O
time NN O
of IN O
construction NN O
this DT O
will MD O
not RB O
have VB O
been VBN O

The DT O
lack NN O
of IN O
attached JJ O
toilet NN O

is VBZ O
again RB O
not RB O
unusual JJ O
for IN O
the DT O
period NN O
, , O
nor CC O
is VBZ O
the DT O
omission NN O
of IN O

as IN O
the DT O

will MD O
have VB O
either CC O
gone VBN O
home NN O
at IN O

or CC O
taken VBN O

. . O

The DT O
covered JJ O
playgrounds NNS O
are VBP O
also RB O
common JJ O
at IN O
this DT O
period NN O
and CC O
indicate VB O
the DT O
desire NN O
for IN O
children NNS O
to TO O
take VB O
exercise NN O
, , O
even RB O
if IN O
the DT O
weather NN O
was VBD O
not RB O
good JJ O

The DT O
head NN O

and CC O

are VBP O
all DT O
relatively RB O
small JJ O
, , O
indeed RB O
, , O
the DT O
staff NN O

are VBP O
very RB O
small JJ O
as IN O
they PRP O
must MD O
have VB O
catered VBN O

up IN O

There EX O

no DT O

differently RB O
